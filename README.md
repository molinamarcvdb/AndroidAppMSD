# SensorDataCollectorApp MSD Project

## Description

This is the repository for the data collection application portion of the Medical Software Development Module.
The task was to utilise a digital biomarker sensor through an android application in order 
to record patient data, analyse it and transmit it to a backend service.

The field of medicine and biomedical research is undergoing a transformation due 
to digital biomarkers. Their use is becoming more widespread, with increasing 
popularity, and the widespread use of wearable technology. Digital biomarkers encompass 
measurable physiological and behavioral indicators that are collected through 
portable, wearable, implantable, or digestible digital devices.

The use case and scientific question that digital biomarkers can answer are typically
related to providing a prognosis, or to support a diagnosis of a condition. Monitoring
a patient recovering from surgery could also be one specific use case. Our project aims
to help clinicians monitor the physical well-being of patients through analysing 
their ability to walk, and to record instances where they may take falls.
The application leverages the accelerometer sensor on the android phone in 
order to detect if an older patient, or a patient with a walking impairment has 
taken a fall, or if their condition and ability to walk is deteriorating over time. 
One use case could be the monitoring of a patients gait in order to track their motor
function recovery after a stroke for example(1). 

Monitoring rehabilitation after an operation
concerning spinal-cord  injuries or lower limb amputations is also a possible
use case for gait analysis (2). Patients with hip dysplasia, geriatric  disorders, or osteoarthritis
could also be monitored to analyse effects of an intervention. Our application
will focus on the detection of falls that a patient who has a walking impairment 
may take, and to monitor their condition remotely.
